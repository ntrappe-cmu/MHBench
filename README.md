# MHBench

## Requirements

1. The cyber-ranges require clusters with 64 threads, 128Gb RAM, and 2Tb SSD.

2. MHBench uses an Openstack deployment to manage the cyberranges. To setup an Openstack deployment there are many options, 
I used single-host deployments with [Devstack](https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/) and [Kolla](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Kolla).
The `openstack_setup` has useful setup scripts and configurations for these deployments.

## Install

Run `uv sync` to install all the Python packages\

## Getting started
